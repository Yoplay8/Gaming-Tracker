# Abstract View - Gaming-Tracker
This was a personal project I started to help keep track of how much time I spent on playing games, watching youtube, or anything that didn't get me closer to my personal goals in life.

The program will keep track of all the time spent doing such activities and the user is responsible for spending more time doing productive activies over unproditive activites. The user will be able to add into the program what is deemed as prodtive and how much time will be deducted based on the given activiy. All prodictive activites will be saved with the amount to deduct. Interest is applied on a daily bases. This is to work as an insentive for the user. If the user has spent more time being unprodictive then the interest will put them farther in debt as an insentive to make them work harder. Where as if the user has spent more time being productive then they will be rewared by the interst giving them more productivity time.

The main idea behind this is that we are using a banking system. Productive time is equal to reciveving cash and un productive time is equal to spending cash. Interest is appplied in the positive or negitive direction depending on the total amount of cash the user has.

I have another idea I may want to implement in the furture. If the user has a negitive amount of time then programs will be blocked. Maybe we could even do websites. The first implmenintation will involve the user deciding what programs should be blocked. The second implmenintaion will involve the program deciding what programs to block by tracking the amount of time a certain program was spent running and to block the programs that were running the longest maybe indicting that thoes programs where the ones causing the user to be unprodictive. This could help elminate the user from cheating. Of course this may not be the best solution becasuse theirs no gurantee that the 2nd implenintiation will block the correct programs.

As of right now the end product should include a way to enter the amount of time spent doing an unproductive activity. Note, time will have to be converted to decimals. Maybe future improvments will involve a drop down menu for hours and minutes. Another section which will hold a list of accountabilities. This section will hold a list of productive activities that can
